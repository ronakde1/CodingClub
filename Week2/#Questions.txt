Easy: 
Find the number of new unique letters required to go from one word to another. 
You can duplicate a letter as many times as you would like to so ab can go to aaab without adding any new letters

For example, for abbcd to bccccdde, you would have to add e so the answer would be 1

Medium:
If a projectile starts from a position 0,0 find its x and y position after t seconds if it has a y velocity, vy and a x velocity vx
Assume no drag and under the influence of gravity (where acceration = 9.8) and SI units
Example, vx=10, vy=10, t=10, answer = 100,-390
Then do this again except it allows for constant acceleration in x and y directions due to drag (assume no gravity)
For 6th form:
Then do this again except is allows for a rate of change of accerlation in x and y directions to model drag more accuratley
