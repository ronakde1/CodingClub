Easy: 
Check whether a string is the same forwards and backwards (Palendrome) 
Medium: 
Give the smallest positive integer made of just 0s and 1s that is divisible by an input, n
For example, if n is 34, the output should be 111010
Hard: 
For a game, you throw darts into a board with 20 segments when the segment is the score. The 1st dart thrown gets double the score. 
All darts go into one of the 20 segments. 
It takes 2 inputs: The first integrer indicating the score (2 to 200). The second integer indicating the number of darts to be thrown. 
Write a program to determine how many different ways a score can be obtained with a given number of drats.
Unique:
